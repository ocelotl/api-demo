Training a model to generate formal normative sentences from informal ones involves a more advanced approach, typically using machine learning and deep learning techniques. This task falls under the category of text generation and could be approached using techniques like sequence-to-sequence models.

Here's a high-level outline of the steps involved in training such a model:

Dataset Preparation:

Collect a dataset of pairs of informal and formal normative sentences.
Ensure each pair is semantically equivalent, representing the same meaning.
Data Preprocessing:

Tokenize the sentences into words or subwords.
Convert words into numerical representations.
Handle any necessary data cleaning or normalization.
Model Selection:

Choose a suitable sequence-to-sequence model architecture. Transformer-based models like GPT-3 or T5 are often used for text generation tasks.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
Train the model on the training set, optimizing for semantic equivalence.
Use a suitable loss function that encourages similarity between the generated and target sentences.
Fine-tune hyperparameters based on the validation set performance.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model on a test set to ensure it generalizes well to new data.
Use metrics like BLEU score, ROUGE score, or semantic similarity metrics to assess the model's performance.
Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for generating formal normative sentences from informal ones.
Below is a simplified example using the Hugging Face Transformers library and the T5 model for training. Note that this is a basic outline, and you might need to adjust it based on your specific requirements and the complexity of your data.

from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assuming you have a list of pairs of informal and formal sentences
informal_sentences = ["Keep the door closed.", ...]
formal_sentences = ["You must keep the door closed.", ...]

# Tokenize the sentences
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-base")
tokenized_inputs = tokenizer(informal_sentences, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
tokenized_targets = tokenizer(formal_sentences, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)

# Split the dataset
input_ids_train, input_ids_val, target_ids_train, target_ids_val = train_test_split(
    tokenized_inputs["input_ids"], tokenized_targets["input_ids"], test_size=0.1, random_state=42
)

# Create DataLoader for training and validation
train_dataset = TensorDataset(input_ids_train, target_ids_train)
val_dataset = TensorDataset(input_ids_val, target_ids_val)
train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)
val_dataloader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=False)

# Model initialization
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-base")

# Training loop
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

num_epochs = 3
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        input_ids, target_ids = batch
        input_ids, target_ids = input_ids.to(device), target_ids.to(device)

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, labels=target_ids)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # Validation
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        total_loss = 0
        for batch in val_dataloader:
            input_ids, target_ids = batch
            input_ids, target_ids = input_ids.to(device), target_ids.to(device)

            outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, labels=target_ids)
            total_loss += outputs.loss.item()

        avg_loss = total_loss / len(val_dataloader)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}/{num_epochs}, Validation Loss: {avg_loss}")

# Example usage to generate formal normative sentence
informal_input = "Close the window."
tokenized_input = tokenizer(informal_input, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
input_ids = tokenized_input["input_ids"].to(device)
output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_beams=4, length_penalty=2.0, early_stopping=True)

formal_output = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print("Formal normative sentence:", formal_output)


This is a basic example and might require fine-tuning based on your specific needs. Additionally, depending on your dataset, you may need to handle domain-specific language or apply more sophisticated preprocessing techniques.
